guilt of not paying attention?

to get a solution for the same

Good morning, we the team Hocus-focus, are going to present our project idea
on how to tackle online class distractions and our team includes myself,
Faerie, and my teammates srivarshan and ashvath.

During this pandemic, over 1.38 billion students worldwide had a impact on
global education due to the closure of schools. The saviour during this
ciris is the online mode of eductaion.

Here, this bar graph illsutrates the challenges identified by student's
during online class.
Overall all, we can infere that, most of the students face connectivity
or resource issue. The immediate next problem faced by them is Lack of 
concentration which sums upto 29.1%. The rest of the issues inclue 
home distraction, lack of practical work and not having a proper routine.

This line graph illustrates the on-task percentage over 10 minutes of studing
across all grade levels during online class. 
Intially, the students are focused
by 70%, but then by the end of 3 mins, the figure dipped significatly by 64%.
Again, we can see a peak in their concentration level upto 71%, but then
gradullay after that, it falls dramitically to about 61% by the end of 10mins.
Overall, the students are distracted drastically over the period of 10mins.

We can cleary see from these statistcs on why we need to overcome distractions
during online class.
